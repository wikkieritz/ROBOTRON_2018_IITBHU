## Description
A line solving Arduino based code operated robot. This robot had secured the second runners position in Robotron 2018, IIT (BHU) Varanasi.
The goal was to make a robot that can operate in manual and autonomous mode to complete the following tasks:
* Manual mode: The operator maneuvers the robot to move three keys distributed in the arena towards the respected RFID tags, which inturn switches off the laser security system and thereby clears the path for the robot to progress.
* Autonomous mode: Once all the lasers are switched off, the robot gets into autonomous mode where it follows a white line on a black surface which is the predefined path towards the destination.
